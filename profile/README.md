StarHeroes is a top-quality third-person space shooter (__TPS__) In the game, you take on the role of a spaceship pilot - Star Hero (__NFT__) - who, along with his team, competes against other players in one of two modes: __Adventure Mode__ or __Ranked Mode__. 

Both modes are ___skill-based___ and ___free-to-play___, as we believe sustainable economy needs to be based on the fun arising from playing a game rather than playing to earn.
