About StarHeores

StarHeroes is a collaborative effort of world tycoons from the gaming and web3 industries.
StarHeroes is a top-quality third-person space shooter (TPS) In the game, you take on the role of a spaceship pilot - Star Hero (NFT) - who, along with his team, competes against other players in one of two modes: Adventure Mode or Ranked Mode. Both modes are skill-based and free to play, as we believe sustainable economy needs to be based on the fun arising from playing a game rather than playing to earn.  One of our main targets is to maximize user experience and limit entry barriers in our game for both traditional and Web3 players.
